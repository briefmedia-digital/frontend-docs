## Overview

This walkthrough is intended to get you up to speed with how we develop frontend products here at Brief Media. Always start with a plan and requirements. With a plan in hand we will create tests to ensure we are maximizing our efficiency. After writing tests we can create the static version of our feature using the components on hand or by building new components as needed. Once we have a static, minimal, feature we can go on to writing more tests for integrating into redux, the web, and our APIs. Once our unit and integrations tests pass we can focus on making sure the end-to-end tests pass. Getting all tests to go green means we are finished.

## The Plan

For this walkthrough a simple tool for searching github will be created. The criteria:

- Use the full suite of frontend tools
  * React/Redux/Router
  * PostCSS
  * TDD including unit/integration/e2e tests
  * Linting
  * Build tools
- Multiple views
- Async data from API
- User input/ interactions
