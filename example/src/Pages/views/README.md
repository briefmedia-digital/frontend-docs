# Views

## What is a view?

A view is similar to a layout except a view has a much smaller scope. Views encapsulate each page or page type effectively becoming like a template. View filenames end with Page.jsx, for example if you are building the Social Media Calendar landing page you would create a SocialMediaCalendarPage.jsx that would hold the SMC feature as well as anything else required to be on the SMC landing page.

Views also double as the components we use for routes.
