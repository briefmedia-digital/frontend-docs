#Pages

###What defines a page?

Views and layouts are templates of our frontend. Layouts are very broad and wrap around major sections of the site while views are meant for each type of page. Views are nested inside of layouts and can be used within any layout type. Layouts should not be confused with theme or brand and layouts are meant to denote different sections of the site for example the content area where general users can browse the site and consume content, another would be the admin section.
