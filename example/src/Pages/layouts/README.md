# Layouts

## What is a layout?

A layout is a master template of sorts. It allows for a parent template that will be shared through a major section of the site. Starting out there is only a single layout that will be shared across both sites. An example of different layouts would be a main layout for the users of the site to browse through and consume our content. Another layout might be the admin section or even just a mini admin section where we can show internal-facing pages for analytics, content settings, etc. and another one might be a seperate layout for custom media projects.
