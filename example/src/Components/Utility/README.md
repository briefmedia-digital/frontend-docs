#Utilities

###What is a Utility component?

Utilities are invisible helpers that act as containers for an entire view or layout. Atoms, Molecules and Organsims build up the UI from the smallest components to the most complex. A Utility is built to be a standalone component that wires underlying functionality together with the rest of the view. Examples of utilities are a site-wide messaging system for things like error messages, or a positive message like the newsletter quiz. A theming utility will also come in handy to manage different themes across different brands, both native and custom media. A user utility will help when showing user-specific UI components. Utilities are meant to compliment the state and help dispatch information to child components.

A good example of a theming component is the Materialize UI's theme component.
