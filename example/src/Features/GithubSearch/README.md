# Github Search

### What is in this example Feature?

For this example I built a simple app that fetches a github user. I created this to demonstrate a few techniques for implementing a feature. I wanted to be able to show how we can get data from an API asynchronously while managing state and the UI.

GithubSearch.jsx exports a connected container component using react-redux's connect method. In this folder you will also find the actions and the reducer files. The redux files should always be within their main component's folder.

There is also the tests folder with an integration test, e2e test and some example unit tests.
