###What is a feature?

A feature is a specific and contained component that can be used anywhere on the site. Features are made up of base components, but have a specific goal laid out by the business requirements. The Social Media Calendar would be considered a Feature, it is made up of cards, and image, and a containing structure. Features are always exported as container components and will generally have their own section in the global state. Features may also have several different containers to export depending on what is needed. For exampe the Social Media Calendar will export both the main SMC feature as well as the homepage SMC block.

###Anatomy of a feature

When starting a feature first write and e2e test and any unit tests that may be needed. When the Feature is completed write any integration tests that are needed. Pull from already created components or add to the components in the apropriate section if needed.
